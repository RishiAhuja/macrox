## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.27.0 or higher
- Dart 3.5.3 or higher
- Firebase account
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RishiAhuja/nexus.git
cd nexus
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Configuration

1. Set up Firebase:

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for your project
flutterfire configure
```

2. Update Firebase configuration:
   - Add your Firebase web app credentials to the appropriate configuration files

### Running Locally

Run the application with the Canvas kit renderer for optimal performance:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer canvaskit
```

For a production build:

```bash
flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit --release
```

## Architecture

Nexus is built following Clean Architecture principles:

```
lib/
├── core/           # Core functionality, configs
├── data/           # Data sources, repositories impl
├── domain/         # Business logic, entities, repositories
├── presentation/   # UI components, BLoCs
│   ├── auth/       # Authentication screens
│   ├── blog/       # Blog creation and viewing
│   ├── explore/    # Explore feed
│   ├── home/       # Home screen
│   ├── landing/    # Landing page
│   └── profile/    # User profiles
└── common/         # Shared widgets, helpers
```

The application follows a strict separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and entities
- **Data Layer**: Handles data access and repository implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: Manages UI and state

For state management, Nexus uses the BLoC pattern with the `flutter_bloc` package, ensuring a unidirectional data flow and predictable state transitions.
